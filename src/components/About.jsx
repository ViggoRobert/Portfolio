                <p class=" text-text text-lg font-fredoka"> I became fascinated with audio in my early teens, honing my skills in crafting immersive sound and now channeling that expertise into the realm of game audio design. I'm also a huge gamer, of course, having grown up on Nintendo and later falling in love with everything from competitive shooters to rhythm games.</p>
